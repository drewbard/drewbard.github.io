So I created this site to be my blog/portfolio site. I was using blogger but I wanted more customization to learn some new things and since I already have a github account I can easily set up github pages. Plus writing in markdown for general CMS just makes more sense than going full on Angular or full stack solution.

##Design Concepts
###Typography
- Tracking : The space between characters in words
- Leading : The space between the spaces between lines of text
- Alignment
  - Left : Used 
  - Center : Titles, don't use it for long pieces of text
  - Right : Usually used for business card
  - Justify : Usually usedin newspaper, be careful it can create odd white space in the paragraph
- Measure - The width of the body of type for a block of text
  - Rules of thumb :
    - Have the max width be rougly 2 - 2.5 alphabet lengths(52 -78 characters)
    - Make the leading roughly to match the measure to increase legibility
- Typeface : a design for a set of characters. Similary font is the size and weight of a set of characters
  - 3 types :
  - Serif : a small line attached to the character or symbol. They have a combination of  thin and thick strokes that make up the character. <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman">Times new Roman</span> is an example. Serifs are good for reading for prolonged period of time.
  - Sans Serif : Good for headlines Sans(French for without) good for headlines and buttons. Have a modern look to them.
  - Script : Immitate handwriting. Used for logos or titles. Generally don't use it for buttons or bodies of text
  
####Warning
Be careful on mixing fonts. For mobile generally stick to one type of font but changing it for logos and/or welcome screens. For web a common strategy is a Sans Serif for a title and a Serif for the body of text

####Helpful Font Links
 - [What the font](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) : good way to upload images to find out the font that they might be using
   - Tip! : In OSX you can use spotlight to find the Font Book. Once opened you can drag and drop your newly download .ttf(True Type Font) right into the list of fonts.
