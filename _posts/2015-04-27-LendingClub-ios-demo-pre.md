I am learning Swift and iOS. So to help it sink in I needed a project because tutorial after tutorial after screencast doesn't really get my creative neurons going sometimes. Also I am experimenting with [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) and was thinking jeez I really am tired of constantly logging in and checking my balance on their website. I needed a swifter<img src="/images/swift.png" width="25px" height="25px">way of doing this and lo and behold the good folks at LendingClub offer a sweet REST API. So of course I signed up and got crack a lackin. So here is what I have so far. It's using Cocoapods, Alamofire, Parse, ios-charts, and HTHorizontalSelectionList. It's still a work in progress but I thought I might as well show what I have so far. I'll write a post on how I did it, what my thoughts were on the ways that I approached it, and what I learned.
