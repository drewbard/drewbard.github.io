## About Me
I'm just a software engineer from a small farm town in Texas who went on an adventure through life to get to the Bay Area. I love to talk about about music, human rights, finance, news, traveling, technology, and sailing. I'm currently getting up to speed on iOS and learning Swift as swiftly as possible :]. This site will be my blog to post things I've learned as well as information about my side projects.
